<h3>What is .DB file?</h3>
    <p>DB file stands for database file.A database file is a file which contains all data relevant to your program stored in a form of table containing rows and
    columns just like MS Excel spreadsheets or Google Sheets.Generally database files are used to store data to keep quering and using data for different tasks
     and purposes.Mostly Database files are written in SQL (Structured Query Language). This program works only with sqlite3 .db file</p>
     
<h3>What is .CSV file?</h3>     
  <p>CSV file stands for comma-separated values which is a method to separate one field with another with the help of comma(,).This file is also used to store
      data but in a different format just same as MS Excel file.In .CSV file every field is separated with a comma(,) within a row and with columns of 
      required fields.CSV files can directly be open with any spreadsheet or CSV editor for e.g MS Excel or Google Sheets.</p>
